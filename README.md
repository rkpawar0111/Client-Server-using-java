# Client-Server-using-java
Client/Server setup for multiple file transfer.


/*

->This is Mini-project on Client/Server setup using low-level API(i.e ports & sockets) with simple user interface.
  1. Primary pacakage requirements are java.net,java.awt,java.io and java.nio.
  2. java.net provides ServerSocket and Socket class which are used at Server and Client side respectively.
  3. java.awt provides BufferedImage class which provides buffer (or) memory space that can be shared between client/server.
  4. java.io and java.nio for working with text and image files.

->The application is capable enough to tranfer only multiple text and image files accross server to client.

->I have added single line code on client side which provides ip address of the client connected to the server, in case if needed to track client.
